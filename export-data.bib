              Background 
              The role of nebulized amphotericin B ({NAB}) in managing pulmonary mucormycosis ({PM}) is unknown. 
             
             
              Methods 
              In this open‐label trial, we randomized {PM} subjects to receive either intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (control arm, 3–5 mg/kg/day) alone or along with nebulized amphotericin B deoxycholate ({NAB}, 10 mg twice a day, every alternate day). The primary outcomes were: (1) overall response (‘success’ [complete or partial response] or ‘failure’ [stable disease, progressive disease, or death]) at 6 weeks; and (2) the proportion of subjects with adverse events ({AE}). The key secondary outcome was 90‐day mortality. We performed a modified intention‐to‐treat ({mITT}) analysis where we included only subjects receiving at least a single dose of {NAB}. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                Fifteen and 17 subjects were randomized to the control and {NAB} arms; two died before the first dose of {NAB}. Finally, we included 30 subjects (15 in each arm; mean age 49.8 years; 80\% men) for the {mITT} analysis. Diabetes mellitus ( 
                n 
                 = 27; 16/27 were {COVID}‐19‐associated {PM}) was the most common predisposing factor. The overall treatment success was not significantly different between the control and the {NAB} arms (71.4\% vs. 53.3\%; 
                p 
                 = .45). Twenty‐nine subjects experienced any {AE}, but none discontinued treatment. The 90‐day mortality was not significantly different between the control (28.6\%) and {NAB} arm (53.3\%; 
                p 
                 = .26). 
               
             
             
              Conclusion 
              Adjunctive {NAB} was safe but did not improve overall response at 6 weeks. A different dosing schedule or nebulized liposomal amphotericin B may still need evaluation. More research is needed to explore other treatment options for {PM}.},

              Background 
              Mucormycosis is a rare infection in lung transplant recipients ({LTR}). Our objective was to better define the clinical presentation and optimal management of this frequently lethal infection. 
             
             
              Methods 
              A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify all published cases of mucormycosis in {LTR} using {PubMed}/{MEDLINE}. These cases were analyzed together with a new case series from our clinic. 
             
             
              Results 
              Literature search yielded 44 articles matching the inclusion criteria, describing 121 cases. Six additional cases were identified from our clinic. Data regarding infection site and outcome were available for a total of 53 patients. The lungs were the most common site of infection (62\%), followed by rhinocerebral and disseminated disease. Most cases (78\%) developed in the first post‐transplant year, with over 40\% of them in the first month. Additional risk factors for mucormycosis were identified in over half of the patients. Surgical debridement was uncommon in pulmonary infection (9\%). Posaconazole therapy was used in 35\% of cases, mostly in combination with amphotericin B. Overall mortality was 32\% but varied according to site of infection. 
             
             
              Conclusion 
              Mucormycosis in {LTRs} tends to be an early post‐surgical infection, associated with additional risk factors and intensified immunosuppressive states, and most often affects the lungs, where surgical debridement is rarely feasible. Posaconazole as first‐line therapy should be further explored.},

              Background 
              Patients with diabetes are known as an important high‐risk group for cerebral mucormycosis ({CM}). 
             
             
              Method 
              We conducted a structured search using {PubMed}/{MEDLINE} to collect both case reports and case series case (ie including at least two patients) onto {CM} in diabetic patient published between 2000 and March 2020. 
             
             
              Results 
              Forty‐five reports of individual cases and eighteen case series articles were included. India accounted for the largest share of reports with 37.7\% and 38.8\% of individual cases and case series, respectively. Mortality ranged from 0\% to 100\% in the case series. The overall mortality in the individual cases was 46.3\%, and 64.2\% of deaths were reported in patients with ketoacidosis diabetes. Facial swelling (53.3\%), headache (44.4\%), loss of vision (35.5\%) and ophthalmoplegia (35.5\%) were the most frequently reported clinical symptoms. In all patients except 4 (91.1\%), {CM} was treated surgically; however, in many cases (42\%), despite the use of surgery, death occurred. Amphotericin B deoxycholate ({AMB}) and lipid‐based {AMB} ({LAMB}) were used as the first lines of treatment for all patients; however, posaconazole, echinocandins, hyperbaric oxygen therapy ({HBOT}) and deferasirox were used in combination for a number of patients. Posaconazole has been shown to have positive therapeutic effect; however, posaconazole, {LAMB} and {HBOT} are not commonly used in low‐income and health‐challenged countries. 
             
             
              Conclusion 
              Cerebral mucormycosis is a rapidly progressive infection in diabetic patients and carries immense morbidity despite early diagnosis and treatment. Low‐income countries have had the highest number of reports of the disease in recent years, indicating the need to control diabetes in these countries.},
