# Case Presentation

## History
*CC:* cardiac arrest

*HPI:*
57-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40%), poorly controlled hypertension, polysubstance use disorder presented to the ED following a cardiac arrest.

History obtained through chart review and conversation with daughter.

## HPI, Continued
- Patient down by a friend, who called EMS
- On arrival, apneic and pulseless
  - initial rhythm: asystole
  - Received CPR x3 rounds with 3 doses of epinephrine
  - Next rhythm: VT
  - DCCV into junctional bradycardia, then transcutaneously paced
  - Intubated in field

## In ED
- TCP discontinued and maintained NSR in 60s
- Concern for decerebrate posturing, so Keppra loaded

- Spoke to daughter, reporting patient has similar prior experiences
  - Recently in rehab for substance use but did not continue because he "felt that his addiction was under control."
  - Reportedly significant increase in his substance use over the past several weeks

## Historical Context 
- Multiple recent hospitalizations
  - (5/12/2023 - 5/15/2023) hypertensive emergency following cocaine and fentanyl use
  - (8/23/2022 - 8/29/2022) hypertensive emergency following cocaine and fentanyl use
    - At that time, patient was intubated in field due to GCS 3
    - MICU admission with concern for PRES

## Remaining History
- PMH: HTN, PSUD, NICM
- PSH: None
- Social:
  - Tobacco: Active smoker, 10 pack years (0.5 ppd for 20 years)
  - Alcohol: Occasional
  - Drugs: inhaled cocaine, fentanyl positive (contamination?)
  - Employment: Unknown

## Exam
- GEN: Intubated. Sedated 
- HEENT: NCAT. No mucosal bleeding
- CARDS: RRR. No MRG
- PULM: Intubated. Inspiratory crackles, L >> R
- GI: Soft, non-distended
- EXT: No peripheral edema. no joint deformities or skin tightness
- DERM: No rashes or lesions

## Interval Story
- Admitted to MICU
- HOD#1: VC 400 cc / RR 20 / PEEP 8 / FIO2 50%
- HOD#2, significant dyssynchrony & escalating FIO2 requirements
  - FIO2 50% --> 100%, PEEP 8 --> 12
  - Paralyzed; FIO2 requirements 100% --> 60%

# Question 1
What is your differential for his diffuse ground glass opacities and hypoxemia?

:::{.incremental}
- ARDS
- Pulmonary edema
- Aspiration pneumonitis
- Infection
- Other

<!--
- infection: bacterial, viral, PJP, mycoplasma
- blood: DAH (vasculitis, trauma, medications, infections)
- protein: PAP
- transduate: pulmonary edema
- cells / inflammation: AIP, ARDS, AEP


## Subacute to Chronic
- PAP
- OP
- vasculitis (GPA, MPN)
- CEP
- lymphangitic tumor spread
- sarcoidosis
- lipid pneumonia

## Cytology
![](data/raw/path_highlight_no.png)

## Story Update
:::{.incremental}
- After bronchoscopy, weaned off cisatracurium
- Remained more synchronus with vent and better P:F
- Remainder of workup negative
  - HIV, PJP, viral panel, bronch cultures
- Other systemic markers improved
  - sCr 2.95 --> 1.40 --> 1.13
:::

## Story Update
![](data/raw/blood_gas.png)

## Presumed Diagnosis
:::{.incremental}
- DAH secondary to inhaled cocaine
  - Considered DAH secondary to aspiration pneumonitis
- Apical predominance
- Rapid improvement without specific interventions
  - *i.e.*, no steroids

  - anti-helminthic
  - effects: cutaneous vasculitis [@pieterse_cracking_2016], agranulocytosis
- Fentanyl
- Talc, silica [@tashkin_airway_2001]

## Cocaine Toxicities: Cardiac

- Myocardial ischemia or infarction
- Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy
- Arrhythmias
- Stroke
- Aortic dissection
- Pulmonary Hypertension [@alzghoul_cocaine_2020]

- ANCA-associated vasculitis [@bucur_pulmonary-renal_2023]
- cardiogenic pulmonary edema [@de_almeida_high-resolution_2014]
- AEP


## Cocaine Toxicities: Neurologic
- 1990, Case Series of 233 patients [@brody_cocaine-related_1990]
- 39.1% had some kind of neurologic symptom
  - acute encephalopathy (27.4%)
  - seizures

# Treatment for Cocaine-Induced DAH

## Supportive Care
- cocaine avoidance
- Bad lung down
- Low tidal volume ventilation

# Learning Objectives
- List differential for acute-onset pulmonary ground glass opacities
- Describe workup for presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
- Describe four life-threatening side effects of inhaled cocaine
- Describe treatment for cocaine-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
