## Questions

### Duke

- What are next steps for Duke tuition payment?

### Boards

- Since I'm done with all clinical rotations, can I take CCM boards prior to PULM?

### Fourth year

- Is staying guaranteed? If no, when would I find that out?

### Paperwork for Clinical Status

- Staying: If I stay, do I need the list of "no negative issues" are _every_ location I've ever rotated at? 

- Would a letter from my med school + residency program + fellowship suffice? 
  - if not and this had to be individual, this list would include over a DOZEN hospital sites
