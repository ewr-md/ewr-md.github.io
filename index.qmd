# Overview

. . .

(@) Summarize exercise limitations after an ICU course
(@) Using Fick Equation, describe factors responsible for oxygen delivery
(@) Understand CPET profile of (1) cardiac and (2) pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise
(@) Summarize contemporary concepts of invasive exercise hemodynamics
(@) Describe CPET features suggesting a ventilatory limitation to exercise

## Scenario 1
You're seeing a 47-year-old male after a prolonged hospital stay.

- admitted for bilateral PNA
- developed acute bilateral PEs; shocky, so got lytics
- remaining course complicated by empyema and PTX with persistent air leak

. . .


**Concerns**

After finishing PT, exercise capacity not at pre-illness baseline

## Scenario 1, Continued

- **Baseline:** 1 hour daily on an elliptical
- **Now:** 20-30 minutes, limited by dyspnea

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
$SpO_2$ drops to 85% on home pulse-ox
:::

. . .

**Symptoms**: No chest pain, dizziness, cough, or lower extremity edema

## Exam
Unremarkable, including normal strength

**PFTs**

|Item|Measure|
|---|---|
|$FEV_1$ (% predicted) |75%|
|FVC (% predicted) |75%|
|$FEV_1/FVC$ |0.77|
|TLC (% predicted)|76%|
|DLCO (% predicted)|81% |

## Remaining Data

**2D Echocardiography**

- Normal LV function
- no LVH or diastolic dysfunction
- normla RV size and function
- IVC collapsing, PASP 25 

# Question 1

- In general, what mechanisms of exercise limitation might be considered in a post-ICU patient? 
- Based on the information provided, what could account for exercise limitation in this particular patient?

## Limitations, in general

. . . 

- deconditioning
- anemia
- new restrictive lung dz from pleural injury
- critical illness myopathy
- residual stress-induced cardiomyopathy
- ?CTEPH

# Question 2

- What do we know generally about the incidence of exercise limitation after an episode of pulmonary embolism? 
- What mechanisms could be implicated?

## Limitations after pulmonary embolism

**Exercise Limitations:** 50-70% at 6-12 months post-PE (based on reduced max $\dot{V}O_2$)

**CTEPH**: requires residual clot material and elevated RHC measures

- incidence 4%
  - larger number likely have CTED (20% RV dysfunction, 10% DOE)

## Limitations after pulmonary embolism
:::{.callout-note}
Size of residual perfusion defect or RV dysfunction don't correlate well with $\downarrow \dot{V}O_2max$

# Question 3
State the Fick equation.

. . .

**Fick Equation**

$CO = \frac{\dot{V}O_2}{(C_aO_2 - C_VO_2)}$

$\dot{V}O_2=CO \cdot (C_aO_2 - C_VO_2)$

# Question 4

In the Fick Equation, what pathophysiological processes are "packaged" within in the Arterial-Venous O2 content difference ($AVO_2D$) term?

. . .

**In other words**

Explain the "$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2}$" part of the Fick equation

## Equation and $AVO_2$ Content

$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2} = AVO_2$ content 

$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2} = (S_{a}O_{2} - M_VO_2) \cdot Hgb \cdot 1.34$

- So, $AVO_2D$ captures:
  - effects of Hgb, gas exchange function, distribution of peripheral blood flow, utilization of oxygen by muscles

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Lungs are only directly represented by $S_aO_2$

# Question 5

What does the $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$ represent conceptually?

## What is $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$ 

***a.k.a*** ventilatory equivalents for $CO_2$

- think: how much MV is occuring per liter of $CO_2$ production
- normal range 25 - 30

:::{.callout-note}
$\frac{V_E}{VCO_2} \propto$ deadspace fraction or $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2} \propto \frac{1}{P_aCO_2}$.
:::

. . .

  - thus reflects a degree of ventilatory efficency

# Question 6

What CPET parameters suggest a primary cardiac limitation?

## Primary Cardiac Limitations

. . .

- Reduced peak $\dot{V}O_2$
- Early-onset AT, $\downarrow \frac{\Delta \dot{V}O_2}{\Delta WR}$ (both indirect indicators of adequacy of oxygen delivery/utilization)
- $\downarrow \frac{\dot{V}O_2}{HR}$ (a.k.a oxygen pulse)
  - approximates reduced SV
- Rapid $\uparrow \uparrow \Delta HR$ relative to $\uparrow \dot{V}O_2$
- Low heart rate reserve ($HRR = HR^{max}_{predicted} - HR^{max}_{achieved}$)

# Question 7

Which parameters suggest a pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise?

## Pulmonary Vascular Limitation

**Similarities:** appears similar to cardiac limitations

. . .

**Unique Features:** 

1. abnormally high exercise $\frac{V_d}{V_t}$
  - often from ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., $\uparrow \frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$)
2. Exertional desaturation during exercise
  - think -- this shouldn't occur with $\downarrow$LVEF or diastolic dysfunction

# Question 8

Which pattern of exercise limitation is present in this patient?

## Interpreting the CPET

## Interpreting the CPET

![](references/cpet_03.png)

## Interpreting the CPET, Takeaways

- low peak $\dot{V}O_2$ (59%, <70% predicted)
- $\uparrow frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$
- elevated $\frac{V_d}{V_t}$ at peak exercise (0.4 vs predicted <0.25)


# Question 9

Interpret the hemodynamics. Does he have CTEPH?

# Question 10

Describe the normal hemodynamic response to exercise and contrast it to this patient.

# Question 11

Will a heart transplant improve this patientâ€™s exercise tolerance?

. . .

### Yes, but it won't resolve them.

## Considerations

- we know he has cardiac limitations
  - elevated $\frac{V_E}{V_{CO_2}}$ slope
  - reduced peak $\dot{V}O_2$

. . .

- also has previously undiagnosed COPD
  - obstruction on spirometry ($\frac{FEV_1}{FVC} = 0.48$)
- dynamic hyperinflation with escalating exercise
  - at end-exercise, such trapping he cannot increase $TV$
  - predicted $MVV = 40 \cdot FEV_1 = 1.4 \cdot 40 = 56$ L
    - peak MV was >70% of MVV, suggesting approaching ventilatory ceiling
