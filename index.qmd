# Overview
## Systematic Reviews, ROCM
Most systematic reviews focus on rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis
[@bhattacharyya_rhino-orbital-cerebral-mucormycosis_2021; @chegini_epidemiology_2020]


## Systematic Reviews, Transplant
Mucor in lung transplant patients [@wand_mucormycosis_2020]
  
  - conclusion: avoid surgery, use amphotericin + posaconazole

# Evidence

## Guidelines
Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of mucormycosis [@cornely_global_2019]

- *first line*: surgical debridement with clean margins
- *next*: liposomal amphotericin B
- *add-on*: isavuconazole or posaconazole

## Outcomes
- Mortality rates have *improved* since 2000 [@muthu_has_2021]
  - survival: medical (31%) vs medical + surgery (69%)
  
|Year|Morality|
|---|---|
| before 2000 | 72.1% |
|2000-2009 | 58.3% |
|2010-2020 | 49.8% |
  
- Despite improvements, mortality rates remain *high* [@jeong_contemporary_2019; @muthu_has_2021]
  - 90-day morality: 41%
  
## Outcomes, Malignancy
- Outcomes in hematologic malignancies poor despite surgery [@kara_mucormycosis-associated_2009]
  - Single center retrospective cohort
  - N = 20, with n = 1 (5%) pulmonary disease
    - 18 (90%) recent surgery
  - morality at 1 month: n = 11 (55%)
  

## Treatments, Medications
- _**MUCONAB trial, 2023**_: RCT of nebulized amphotericin B [@muthu_treatment_2023]
  - conclusion: no improvement in outcomes
- RCT of topical amphotericin gel at surgical site in COVID-associated mucormycosis [@shaikh_evaluate_2023]
  - patients: nasopharyngeal mucor
  - intervention: 0.1% Liposomal Amphotericin-B gel vs 10% povidone-iodine and saline
  - outcome: need for surgical revision
  - result: fewer revisions

## Treatment, Medications
**_COVID Associated Mucormycosis_** [@shaikh_evaluate_2023]

**Conclusion**: "Topical Amphotericin-B gel application in the postoperative cavity can decrease the need for revision surgery."

## Treatment, Medications
- Case-control study isavuconazole [@marty_isavuconazole_2016]
  - **Conclusion**: "Isavuconazole showed activity against mucormycosis with efficacy similar to amphotericin B."

## Treatment, Surgery
1994: *Seminal* Ann Thorac Surg Review out of Duke [@tedder_pulmonary_1994]

- N = 255
- Morality statistics below


|Group|n (%)|
|---|---|
|overall|204 (80.0%)|
|isolated pulmonary mucor|166 (65.1%)|
|Medication, all comers|173 (67.8%)|
|Surgery, all comers|28 (11.0%)|

## Treatment, Surgery
:::{.callout-warning}
- Only 44% (92/209) of patients with pulmonary mucormycosis were diagnosed premortem!
:::

|treatment|n (%)|
|---|---|
|medical only|56 (61%)|
|surgery only|19 (21%)|
|medical + surgery|17 (18%)|

## Treatment, Surgery Specifics   
Of the surgically treated patients with pulmonary-localized disease:

|treatment|n (%)|
|---|---|
|lobectomy|22 (61.1%)|
|pneumonectomy|4 (11.1%)|
|wedge resection|3 (8.3%)|
|unspecified|7 (19.4%)|

## Treatment, Surgery
- Meta-anlysis of 92 pulmonary mucor cases [@feng_characteristics_2018]

**Correlates of Survival**

|Treatment|OR [95% CI]|
|---|---|
|Medication vs not|53.9 \[3.1-945.6\]|
|Surgery vs not|5.983 [1.5-23.9]|

# Conclusions

- **Medications**
  - Yes. amphotericin + azole (isavuconazole or posaconazole)
- **Surgery**
  - Likely yes, preferably early.
