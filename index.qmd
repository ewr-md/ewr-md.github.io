# Overview

. . .

(@) Summarize exercise limitations after an ICU course
(@) Using Fick Equation, describe factors responsible for oxygen delivery
(@) Understand CPET profile of (1) cardiac and (2) pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise
(@) Summarize contemporary concepts of invasive exercise hemodynamics
(@) Describe CPET features suggesting a ventilatory limitation to exercise

## Scenario 1
You're seeing a 47-year-old male after a prolonged hospital stay.

- admitted for bilateral PNA
- developed acute bilateral PEs; shocky, so got lytics
- remaining course complicated by empyema and PTX with persistent air leak

. . .


**Concerns**

After finishing PT, exercise capacity not at pre-illness baseline

## Scenario 1, Contiued

- **Baseline:** 1 hour daily on an elliptical
- **Now:** 20-30 minutes, limited by dyspnea

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
$SpO_2$ drops to $85\%$ on home pulse-ox
:::

. . .

**Symptoms**: No chest pain, dizziness, cough, or lower extremity edema

## Exam
Unremarkable, including normal strength

**PFTs**

|Item|Measure|
|---|---|
|$FEV_1$ (% predicted) |75%|
|FVC (% predicted) |75%|
|$\frac{FEV_1}{FVC}|0.77|
|TLC (% predicted)|76%|
|$\frac{MIP}{MEP}$ (% predicted)|100% |
|DLCO (% predicted)|81% |

**2D Echocardiography**

- Normal LV size and function, normal left-sided valves
- No LVH or signs of diastolic dysfunction
- RV normal size and function, IVC collapsing, PASP 25 

## stuff
A recent chest radiograph revealed mild pleural thickening on the side of his prior empyema but was otherwise normal.

# Question 1

In general, what mechanisms of exercise limitation might be considered in a post-ICU patient? Based on the information provided, what could account for exercise limitation in this particular patient?

## Question 2

What do we know generally about the incidence of exercise limitation after an episode of pulmonary embolism? What mechanisms could be implicated?

## Question 3
State the Fick equation.

### Fick Equation

$VO_2=CO \cdot \frac{CO}{C_aO_2 - C_vO_2}$

## Question 4

What pathophysiological processes are “packaged” within in the Arterial-Venous O2 content difference ($AVO_2D$) term?

## Question 5

What does the $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$ represent conceptually?

## Question 6

What CPET parameters suggest a primary cardiac limitation?

## Question 7

Which parameters suggest a pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise?

## Question 8

Which pattern of exercise limitation is present in this patient?

## Question 9

Interpret the hemodynamics. Does he have CTEPH?

## Question 10

Describe the normal hemodynamic response to exercise and contrast it to this patient.

## Question 11

Will a heart transplant improve this patient’s exercise tolerance?
