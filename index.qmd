# Overview

. . .

(@) Summarize exercise limitations after an ICU course
(@) Using Fick Equation, describe factors responsible for oxygen delivery
(@) Understand CPET profile of (1) cardiac and (2) pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise
(@) Summarize contemporary concepts of invasive exercise hemodynamics
(@) Describe CPET features suggesting a ventilatory limitation to exercise

## Scenario 1
You're seeing a 47-year-old male after a prolonged hospital stay.

- admitted for bilateral PNA
- developed acute bilateral PEs; shocky, so got lytics
- remaining course complicated by empyema and PTX with persistent air leak

. . .


**Concerns**

After finishing PT, exercise capacity not at pre-illness baseline

## Scenario 1, Continued

- **Baseline:** 1 hour daily on an elliptical
- **Now:** 20-30 minutes, limited by dyspnea

. . .

:::{.callout-important}
$SpO_2$ drops to 85% on home pulse-ox
:::

. . .

**Symptoms**: No chest pain, dizziness, cough, or lower extremity edema

## Exam
Unremarkable, including normal strength

**PFTs**

|Item|Measure|
|---|---|
|$FEV_1$ (% predicted) |75%|
|FVC (% predicted) |75%|
|$FEV_1/FVC$ |0.77|
|TLC (% predicted)|76%|
|DLCO (% predicted)|81% |

## Remaining Data

**2D Echocardiography**

- Normal LV function
- no LVH or diastolic dysfunction
- normla RV size and function
- IVC collapsing, PASP 25 

# Question 1

- In general, what mechanisms of exercise limitation might be considered in a post-ICU patient? 
- Based on the information provided, what could account for exercise limitation in this particular patient?

## Limitations, in general

. . . 

- deconditioning
- anemia
- new restrictive lung dz from pleural injury
- critical illness myopathy
- residual stress-induced cardiomyopathy
- ?CTEPH

# Question 2

- What do we know generally about the incidence of exercise limitation after an episode of pulmonary embolism? 
- What mechanisms could be implicated?

## Limitations after pulmonary embolism

**Exercise Limitations:** 50-70% at 6-12 months post-PE (based on reduced max $\dot{V}O_2$)

**CTEPH**: requires residual clot material and elevated RHC measures

- incidence 4%
  - larger number likely have CTED (20% RV dysfunction, 10% DOE)

## Limitations after pulmonary embolism
:::{.callout-note}
Size of residual perfusion defect or RV dysfunction don't correlate well with $\downarrow \dot{V}O_2max$

# Question 3
State the Fick equation.

. . .

**Fick Equation**

$CO = \frac{\dot{V}O_2}{C_aO_2 - C_VO_2}$

$\dot{V}O_2=CO \cdot (C_aO_2 - C_VO_2)$

# Question 4

In the Fick Equation, what pathophysiological processes are "packaged" within in the Arterial-Venous O2 content difference ($AVO_2D$) term?

. . .

**In other words**

Explain the "$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2}$" part of the Fick equation

## $AVO_2$ Content Difference

$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2} = AVO_2$ content difference 

$C_{a}O_{2} - C_{v}O_{2} = (S_{a}O_{2} - M_VO_2) \cdot Hgb \cdot 1.34$

- So, $AVO_2D$ captures:
  - effects of Hgb, gas exchange function, distribution of peripheral blood flow, utilization of oxygen by muscles

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Lungs are only directly represented by $S_aO_2$
:::


# Question 5

What does the $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$ represent conceptually?

## What is $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$ 

***a.k.a*** ventilatory equivalents for $CO_2$

- think: how much MV is occuring per liter of $CO_2$ production
- normal range 25 - 30

:::{.callout-note}
$\frac{V_E}{VCO_2} \propto$ deadspace fraction or $\frac{V_E}{VCO_2} \propto \frac{1}{P_aCO_2}$.
:::

. . .

  - thus reflects a degree of ventilatory efficency

# Question 6

What CPET parameters suggest a primary cardiac limitation?

## Primary Cardiac Limitations

. . .

- Reduced peak $\dot{V}O_2$
- Early-onset AT, $\downarrow \frac{\Delta \dot{V}O_2}{\Delta WR}$ (both indirect indicators of adequacy of oxygen delivery/utilization)
- $\downarrow \frac{\dot{V}O_2}{HR}$ (a.k.a oxygen pulse)
  - approximates reduced SV
- Rapid $\uparrow \uparrow \Delta HR$ relative to $\uparrow \dot{V}O_2$
- Low heart rate reserve ($HRR = HR^{max}_{predicted} - HR^{max}_{achieved}$)

# Question 7

Which parameters suggest a pulmonary vascular limitation to exercise?

## Pulmonary Vascular Limitation

**Similarities:** appears similar to cardiac limitations

. . .

**Unique Features:** 

1. abnormally high exercise $\frac{V_d}{V_t}$
  - often from ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., $\uparrow \frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$)
2. Exertional desaturation during exercise
  - think -- this shouldn't occur with $\downarrow$LVEF or diastolic dysfunction

# Question 8

Which pattern of exercise limitation is present in this patient?

## Interpreting the CPET

## Interpreting the CPET

![](references/cpet_02.png){fig-align="center"}

## Interpreting the CPET

![](references/cpet_03.png){fig-align="center"}

## Interpreting the CPET, Takeaways

- low peak $\dot{V}O_2$ (59%, <70% predicted)
- $\uparrow \frac{V_E}{VCO_2}$
- elevated $\frac{V_d}{V_t}$ at peak exercise (0.4 vs predicted <0.25)

. . .

**Thus**

$\implies$ cardiac, with limitation from ?PVD

## Further Testing

Patient undergoes VQ and CTA scans

- complete occlusion of bilateral lower lobe pulmonary artery branches
- thereafter undergoes RHC

# Question 9

Interpret the hemodynamics. Does he have CTEPH?

## RHC Data, at rest

| Chamber | Measure |
|---|---|
|RA (mmHg)| 2|
|PA (mmHg)|27/8 (17)|
|PCWP (mmHg)|4|
|tCO (L/min)|6.2|
|PVR (WU)|2|

. . .

**Conclusion**

No. But his mPAP gets a lot higher -- does he have something else?

## RHC Data, with exercise


| Chamber | Measure |
|---|---|
|RA (mmHg)| 12|
|PA (mmHg)|100/25 (56)|
|PCWP (mmHg)|17|
|tCO (L/min)|15|
|PVR (WU)|2.6|
|TPR |3.7|
|lactate |0.7 at rest, 1.9 at peak|

# Question 10

Describe the normal hemodynamic response (i.e., RHC numbers) to exercise and contrast it to this patient.

## Normal Reponse to Exercise

**Normal**

|RA | -|

|TPR | $\downarrow$|

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Our patient:**

| Chamber | Change |
|---|---|
|RA | -|
|PA | $\uparrow \uparrow$|
|PCWP | $\uparrow$|
|tCO | $\uparrow$|
|PVR | $\uparrow$|
|TPR | $\uparrow$|
:::

::::

## His mPAP gets a lot higher – does he have something else?

**Exercise PH**

 - Definition: $\frac{mPAP}{CO} > 3$ mmHg/L/min

. . . 

- Our patient: $\frac{mPAP}{CO} = \frac{56}{15} = 3.73$

. . .

- what about $PCWP = 17$? 

. . .

-
  - $PCWP \leq 20$ normal

## Clinical Update

Given the functional limitations, CPET findings, and complete obstruction of blood flow to his bilateral lower lobe pulmonary arteries, he was referred for multidisciplinary discussion in consideration of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

## Clinical Update

Scant evidence to guide this decision.

In overt *CTEPH*, a prospective observational study (DOI: [10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016522](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.016522) suggested better survival in PTE candidates vs non-op.

He was deemed to be a good candidate and is slated for surgery in the near future.

## Scenario 2

65-year-old man with HFrEF (EF 15%) from ischemic cardiomyopathy is referred for CPET.

Severly limited in exercise capacity.

*His goals:* optimize his HF management to maximize quality of life.

# Question 11

Will a heart transplant improve this patient’s exercise tolerance?

. . .

Yes, but it won't resolve everything.

## Considerations

- we know he has cardiac limitations
  - elevated $\frac{V_E}{V_{CO_2}}$ slope
  - reduced peak $\dot{V}O_2$

. . .

- also has previously undiagnosed COPD
  - obstruction on spirometry ($\frac{FEV_1}{FVC} = 0.48$)

## Considerations

- dynamic hyperinflation with escalating exercise
  - at end-exercise, such trapping he cannot increase $TV$
  - predicted $MVV = 40 \cdot FEV_1 = 1.4 \cdot 40 = 56$ L
    - peak MV was >70% of MVV, suggesting approaching ventilatory ceiling
