# Abstract
## Rationale
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
The extent of medication non-adherence in PAH is uncertain and may contribute to adverse outcomes.
There has been a lack of multi-center, registry-based studies assessing medication non-adherence and patient-centered outcomes in PAH.

## Objectives
To determine the incidence of self-reported non-adherence in Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) patients with PAH or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and the association of non-adherence with several patient-centered outcomes (mortality, hospitalization rates, emergency department [ED] visits, and health-related quality of life [HRQoL]).

## Methods
Self-reported PAH medication non-adherence was captured at enrollment and during follow-up visits.
Predictors of non-adherence were modeled using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) assuming a binary distribution.
Outcomes associated with non-adherence were modeled using GEE with a Poisson distribution.

## Results 
A total of `r numTotal` patients were included, of whom `r sexborn_female` (`r printPercent(sexborn_female)`%) were female and `r pah` (`r printPercent(pah)`%) had PAH.
The overall rate of self-reported non-adherence was `r overall_rNA`% (95% confidence interval (CI) `r printCIshort(sigfigs_or, overall_ciLowNA, overall_ciHighNA)`).
Predictors of non-adherence included self-reported male sex (odds ratio (OR) `r printSigs(sigfigs_or, sexborn_or)`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or,sexborn_or_ciLow, sexborn_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(sexborn_or_pVal)`), poverty (OR `r BELOW_POV_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, BELOW_POV_or_ciLow, BELOW_POV_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(BELOW_POV_or_pVal)`), not being partnered (OR `r unpartnered_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, unpartnered_or_ciLow, unpartnered_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(unpartnered_or_pVal)`), having Medicaid or no health insurance (OR `r medicaid1_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, medicaid1_ciLow, medicaid1_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(medicaid1_pVal)`), and having completed high school but not having a college degree (OR `r education_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, education_or_ciLow, education_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(education_or_pVal)`).
PHAR patients who reported non-adherence had `r printOR_percent(ernum_na, ernum_ad)`% more ED visits (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(ernum_pVal)`), `r printOR_percent(hospnum_na, hospnum_ad)`% more hospital admissions (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(hospnum_pVal)`), and `r printOR_percent(hospstaytotal_na, hospstaytotal_ad)`% more days hospitalized (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(hospstaytotal_pVal)`). 
No relationship was observed between non-adherence and type or number of PAH therapies or non-adherence and all-cause mortality.
Patients reporting non-adherence had worse mean SF-12 scores (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(sfment_pVal)`) and worse emPHasis-10 scores (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(emph10score_pVal)`).

## Conclusions
The rate of self-reported non-adherence in PHAR registrants was low but was associated with male sex and several social determinants of health.
While complexity or type of PAH regimen did not appear to influence non-adherence, non-adherence was associated with numerous adverse patient-centered outcomes, including higher healthcare utilization and worse HRQoL.

# Introduction 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an incurable disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Numerous therapies are now available for PAH that can ameliorate symptom burden and avoid untoward outcomes such as hospitalizations.
With many treatment options available, therapeutic regimens have inherent heterogeneity that differ according to disease severity and patient and provider preferences [@Taichman2014; @Burger2018].
Heart failure has similar therapeutic complexity, and medication non-adherence in that population has been shown to be associated with higher symptom burden, rates of hospitalization, and even death [@Wu2018].
Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with PAH, medication non-adherence may be similarly important.
Several studies have attempted to quantify patients' rates of adherence to PAH therapy using pharmacy claims data, with most showing high adherence rates (>= 85%) relative to other rare diseases [@Grady2018; @Waxman2013; @Paolella2019]. 
Factors associated with lower adherence rates include dosing frequency, higher co-payments, and receipt of medications from a non-specialty pharmacy [@Grady2018; @Waxman2013].
Single-center studies at PAH centers have suggested a higher rate of adverse events among those who do not adhere to therapies [@Paolella2019; @Shah2019]. 
However, few studies have used multi-center, registry-based data to assess medication non-adherence and patient-centered outcomes in PAH.
The study of contributors to medication non-adherence is especially relevant as the field begins to move toward more complex multidrug regimens to achieve low-risk disease status.

In this study, we sought to examine the incidence of patient non-adherence to prescribed therapies for PAH and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), understand predictors of non-adherence, and in turn determine whether non-adherence predicts a set of patient-focused outcomes.
Primary patient-centered outcomes included overall survival, number of hospitalizations, number of days spent in the hospital, and number of ED visits.
Key secondary outcomes included patient-perceived HRQoL, as assess by the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and emPHasis-10 tools.
We hypothesized that the prevalence of medication non-adherence would be >= 10%, would be higher in patients with low SES, and that non-adherence itself would predict higher rates of ED visits, hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality.

# Methods  

## Study Design 
The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) is a national registry of patients with PAH and CTEPH.
PHAR collects voluntary data from patients cared for at participating accredited Pulmonary Hypertension Care Centers throughout the United States.
Their data are then shared between institutions for research purposes.
Further details on PHAR methods have been previously published [@borgese_emphasis-10_2021].

This project was reviewed by the Institutional Review Boards at both The Miriam Hospital (`r irb_brown`) and the sIRB for PHAR at the University of Pennsylvania (`r irb_penn`).

The primary exposure variable was medication non-adherence, as measured by a series of survey questions.
Two questionnaires, one given to all PHAR registrants at registry enrollment and another during subsequent follow-up visits (see Supplemental Materials) were utilized to gather data relating to self-reported non-adherence.
The primary outcome of interest was estimating incidence of self-reported non-adherence.
Second, we assessed if certain groups were at higher risk of non-adherence than others.
Third, we assessed if non-adherence was a predictor of outcomes, including overall mortality, hospitalization rates, number of ED visits, and patient-perceived HRQoL as measured by emPHasis-10 and SF-12 scores [@ware_12-item_1996; @borgese_emphasis-10_2021]]. 
Baseline data of patients included age, self-reported biological sex at birth, self-reported race or ethnicity, level of education, income, and type of medical insurance; PAH assessments including World Health Organization functional class (WHO FC), distance on six-minute walk distance (6MWD); brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal (NT)-proBNP levels; hemodynamic measures (all parameters from right heart catheterization); and types of and number of PAH therapies at time of enrollment and during follow-up.
In addition to all-cause hospitalizations, longitudinal data collected at interval follow-ups included repeat values of all of the above-mentioned parameters.

## Statistical Analyses
We used prospective questions, which all patients had the opportunity to answer, to predict non-adherence behavior.
Non-response to non-adherence questions was treated as a "no" response, since due to survey design, a skipped response likely meant "no"; this choice purposefully allowed biasing toward the null hypothesis. 
We limited our observations window to seven visits, as more visits were infrequent.
Duration of non-adherence was not examined because reported non-adherence was already infrequent and often not clarified in duration.
Thus, any report of non-adherence was treated as non-adherence.
The final visit was used as last known follow-up.

Predictors of non-adherence were modeled using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) assuming a binary distribution, where observations were nested within patients with sandwich estimation.
Visit numbers were not treated differently, as non-adherence did not differ based on the number of follow-ups.
Outcomes associated with non-adherence were modeled using GEE with a Poisson distribution.
All modeling was accomplished using SAS 9.4 with the GLIMMIX procedure with normal, log-normal, and Poisson distributions, where appropriate. 
Baseline demographic and patient characteristics were summarized using proportions and frequencies.

Alpha was set at the 0.05 level, and all interval estimates were calculated for 95% confidence. 
The false discovery rate was set _a priori_ at 0.15; Benjamini-Hochberg critical values are provided (see Supplemental Materials).

# Results
There were `r numTotal` patients, of whom `r sexborn_female` (`r printPercent(sexborn_female)`%) were self-reported biological females. 
The median age was `r printSigs(sigfigs_or, df["misc.age_median"])` years old (interquartile range `r printSigs(sigfigs_or, df["misc.age_IQR_low"])`--`r printSigs(sigfigs_or, df["misc.age_IQR_high"])`).
Most subjects had PAH (`r pah` patients, or `r printPercent(pah)`%), and the remainder had CTEPH (`r cteph`  patients, or `r printPercent(cteph)`%) or their PH group data was missing (`r printSigs(sigfigs_or, wsph_missing)`, or `r printPercent(wsph_missing)`%).
Patient selection and detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:studyFlow) and Table \@ref(tab:tabDemographics).

## Incidence and Predictors of Non-Adherence
The overall rate of self-reported non-adherence was lower than expected, at `r overall_rNA`% (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, overall_ciLowNA, overall_ciHighNA)`), which was significantly less than 10.0% (p < 0.01).
Predictors of non-adherence included self-reported male sex (odds ratio (OR) `r sexborn_or `, (95% confidence intervals (CI) `r printCIshort(sigfigs_or, sexborn_or_ciLow, sexborn_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(sexborn_or_pVal)`), poverty (defined as income \<$16,000) (OR `r BELOW_POV_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, BELOW_POV_or_ciLow, BELOW_POV_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(BELOW_POV_or_pVal)`), not being married or partnered (OR `r unpartnered_or`, `r printCI(sigfigs_or, unpartnered_or_ciLow, unpartnered_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(unpartnered_or_pVal)`), having Medicaid or no health insurance (OR `r medicaid1_or`; `r printCI(sigfigs_or, medicaid1_ciLow, medicaid1_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(medicaid1_pVal)`), and having completed high school but not having a college degree compared to having a college degree (OR `r education_or`, `r printCI(sigfigs_or, education_or_ciLow, education_or_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(education_or_pVal)`) (see Table \@ref(tab:tabPredictors)).

There were no statistically significant differences in rates of non-adherence by race (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(race_pVal)`), ethnicity (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(ethnicity_pVal)`), employment status (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(employment_pVal)`), or type of PH.

## Outcomes Associated with Non-Adherence
Non-adherence was associated with an increased number of ED visits (`r ernum_na`, `r printCI(sigfigs_or, ernum_na_ciLow, ernum_na_ciHigh)`, in non-adherence versus `r ernum_ad`, `r printCI(sigfigs_or, ernum_ad_ciLow, ernum_ad_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(ernum_pVal)` in adherent patients), number of hospital admissions (`r hospnum_na` admissions (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, hospnum_na_ciLow, hospnum_na_ciHigh)`) versus `r hospnum_ad` admissions (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, hospnum_ad_ciLow, hospnum_ad_ciHigh)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(hospnum_pVal)`), and days admitted to the hospital (`r hospstaytotal_na` days (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, hospstaytotal_ciLowNA, hospstaytotal_ciHighNA)`) versus `r hospstaytotal_ad` days (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, hospstaytotal_ciLowAD, hospstaytotal_ciHighAD)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(hospstaytotal_pVal)`) (see Table \@ref(tab:tabOutcomes) and Figures \@ref(fig:figOutcomesClinical) and \@ref(fig:figOutcomesHrqol)).
In other words, PHAR patients who were non-adherent had `r printOR_percent(ernum_na, ernum_ad)`% more ED visits, `r printOR_percent(hospnum_na, hospnum_ad)`% more hospital admissions, and `r printOR_percent(hospstaytotal_na, hospstaytotal_ad)`% more days hospitalized compared to adherent patients.
No relationship was observed between non-adherence and all-cause mortality.

Patients reporting non-adherence had lower (worse) mean SF-12 scores (`r sfment_na` (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, sfment_na_ciLowNA, sfment_na_ciHighNA)`) versus `r sfment_ad` (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, sfment_ad_ciLowAD, sfment_ad_ciHighAD)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(sfment_pVal)`) and higher (worse) emPHasis-10 scores (`r emph10score_na` (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, emph10score_na_ciLowNA, emph10score_na_ciHighNA)`) versus `r emph10score_ad` (`r printCI(sigfigs_or, emph10score_ad_ciLowAD, emph10score_ad_ciHighAD)`; p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(emph10score_pVal)`), with both of these results implying worse self-reported physical functioning and more health-related limitations in patients' daily lives.

## `r section_nonSig`
Patients 
There was no relationship observed between non-adherence and WHO FC (did not converged due to ceiling effect), NTPBNP (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(ntpbnp_pVal)`), or 6MWD (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(sixm_pVal)`), nor were there an association between non-adherence and right heart catheterization measures (Table \@ref(tab:tabSeverity)).

Finally, we failed to detect associations between non-adherence and specific PAH treatment regimens, including the number of medications at time of last follow up (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(nummeds_now_pVal)`) or ever taken (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(nummeds_ever_pVal)`), whether a patient was taking an inhaled (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(prost_i_pVal)`) or parenteral prostacyclin (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(prost_p_pVal)`), or the type of oral medication(s) taken (p `r check_pVal_sigfigs_withString(type_meds_pVal)`).

# Discussion  
We have found that self-reported non-adherence in a large national registry of patients with PAH and CTEPH is associated with a number of factors related to social determinants of health and that non-adherence, despite its low rate, is associated with adverse events, as evidenced by higher rates of ED visits, hospital visits, number of hospitalizations, and worse general and disease-specific HRQoL. 

The overall rate of reported non-adherence (`r overall_rNA`%) was somewhat lower than expected.
While prior research in this area is limited, definitions of non-adherence and the inclusion of sub-types of PH have varied across studies.
Some have utilized pharmacy claims data to define adherence by percentage of days covered >= 80%, with one older report showing non-adherence rates of 34% to 68% for patients with PAH taking only phosphodiesterase inhibitor monotherapy [@Waxman2013].
In line with our results, more recent pharmacy claims data have suggested non-adherence rates between 3% and 12% [@Paolella2019; @Shah2019].
One study of patients with PAH, CTEPH, and WHO group 5 disease utilized the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) questionnaire showing 6.0% of patients had "low adherence," defined as an MMAS-8 score <6, surprisingly similar to our estimate in PHAR [@Grady2018].

The association found here between non-adherence and increased hospital usage is clinically important, as any hospitalization within six months results in an increase in the REVEAL assessment score [@benza_predicting_2019].
Min et al. demonstrated with PHAR data that risk assessment scores (as assessed by REVEAL and COMPERA) track with subsequent hospitalization likelihood and HRQoL [@min_prediction_2021].
Hospitalizations have previously been associated with all-cause morality in PAH, which suggests it could be a meaningful surrogate marker [@ventetuolo_surrogate_2008].
If non-adherence contributes indirectly to risk assessment scores and directly to hospitalizations in PAH, efforts to improve adherence and understand barriers to PAH medication as prescribed may lead to cost-effective PAH care. 

Non-adherence was correlated with worse reported HRQoL, as evidenced by lower SF-12 and higher emPHasis-10 scores.
However, these findings should be taken with caution, as prior studies suggest minimally important clinical differences (MCIDs) of 6 to 8 points for emPHasis-10 [@kolaitis_clinical_2021;@hendriks_longitudinal_2021] and 5 points for SF-12 [@kolaitis_clinical_2021].
Thus, while we found a statistically significant difference, this may not represent a clinically meaningful difference.

PAH medications are known to have significant side effects, including headaches, flushing, jaw pain, and peripheral edema, so it is possible some non-adherence was to ameliorate these effects, which could confound self-reported HRQoL indices [@thenappan_pulmonary_2018].
However, our results showed no significant association between medication type, use of more burdensome medications (especially parenteral therapies), or the number of medications.
While our data here are not conclusive, it is plausible that difficulties accessing medication at all (due either to personal difficulties or structural disadvantages) is more predictive of non-adherence than the specific medication regimen.

Somewhat contrary to our hypothesis, there were inconsistent findings detected between social determinants of health and non-adherence.
Predictors included male sex, poverty, and having either Medicaid or no health insurance, but other factors such as race and ethnicity or level of education, had no evidence of being associated with non-adherence.
As patients with Medicaid or no insurance had significantly more non-adherence, economic drivers may be critical determinants of medication non-adherence in PAH, as suggested by prior studies [@Burger2014;@Talwar2017].
This is a timely finding, given the changing and problematic landscape of patient-assistance programs.
Non-adherence may also influence sex-based disparities in PAH, as males are known to have worse outcomes despite a lower prevalence of disease [@terjung_sex_2019].

Finally, several important limitations to this study should be mentioned.
The survey data utilized here depends on self-reported non-adherence, and we suspect the true rate of non-adherence is likely higher than described.
There is ample evidence in behavioral psychology that social desirability may bias individuals to report in a self-favoring manner in studies such as ours [@kristiansen_social_1984; @nederhof_methods_1985; @king_social_2000; @tourangeau_sensitive_2007].
The PHAR dataset does not include validated scales to assess for the possibility of social desirability bias.
Also, PHAR consists exclusively of voluntarily patients who may have characteristics dissimilar to non-enrolled patients and thus may have a different tendency toward adherence.

Overall, our study shows a fairly low rate of non-adherence for patients with PAH and CTEPH.
Given the significant associated improvement in HRQoL and survival associated with PAH therapies, further research into methods to improve adherence could potentially lead to reduced ED visits, hospital stays, and better overall patient outcomes.
