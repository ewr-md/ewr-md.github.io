# Case Presentation

## History
*CC:* cardiac arrest

*HPI:*
57-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 40%), poorly controlled hypertension, polysubstance use disorder presented to the ED following a cardiac arrest.

History obtained through chart review and conversation with daughter.

## HPI, Continued
- Patient down by a friend, who called EMS
- On arrival, apneic and pulseless
  - initial rhythm: asystole
  - Received CPR x3 rounds with 3 doses of epinephrine
  - Next rhythm: VT
  - DCCV into junctional bradycardia, then transcutaneously paced
  - Intubated in field

## In ED
- TCP discontinued and maintained NSR in 60s
- Concern for decerebrate posturing, so Keppra loaded

- Spoke to daughter, reporting patient has similar prior experiences
  - Recently in rehab for substance use but did not continue because he "felt that his addiction was under control."
  - Reportedly significant increase in his substance use over the past several weeks

## Historical Context 
- Multiple recent hospitalizations
  - (5/12/2023 - 5/15/2023) hypertensive emergency following cocaine and fentanyl use
  - (8/23/2022 - 8/29/2022) hypertensive emergency following cocaine and fentanyl use
    - At that time, patient was intubated in field due to GCS 3
    - MICU admission with concern for PRES

## Remaining History
- PMH: HTN, PSUD, NICM
- PSH: None
- Social:
  - Tobacco: Active smoker, 10 pack years (0.5 ppd for 20 years)
  - Alcohol: Occasional
  - Drugs: inhaled cocaine, fentanyl positive (contamination?)
  - Employment: Unknown

## Vitals

## Exam
- GEN: Intubated. Sedated 
- HEENT: NCAT. No mucosal bleeding
- CARDS: RRR. No MRG
- PULM: Intubated. Inspiratory crackles, L >> R
- GI: Soft, non-distended
- EXT: No peripheral edema
- DERM: No rashes or lesions

## Interval Story
- Admitted to MICU
  - Vent, HOD#1:
- HOD#2, significant dyssynchrony & escalating FIO2 requirements
  - Paralyzed, with reduction in FIO2 requirements (100%-->40%)

# Question 1
What is your differential for his diffuse ground glass opacities and hypoxemia?

## Ground Glass Opacities

### Acute
Categories
- infection
- blood
- protein
- cells
- inflammation

- pulmonary edema
- pulmonary infection
  - bacterial, viral, PJP, mycoplasma
- AIP (acute interstitial pneumonia)
- ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- DAH (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage)
- AEP (acute eosinphilic pneumonia)


### Subacute to Chronic
- UIP
- NSIP
- PAP
- OP
- vasculitis (GPA, MPN)
- CEP
- lymphangitic tumor spread
- sarcoidosis
- lipid pneumonia
- alveolar microlithasis


## Diagnosing DAH

## Treating DAH


## Differential diagnosis for acute-onset pulmonary ground glass opacities.
## Diagnostic workup for presumed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
## Life-threatening side effects of inhaled cocaine use.
## Treatment for cocaine-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

# Background
<!--DEC 2022 

ams w cf seizure. midaz then aed loaded (keppra). hypertensive. cxr w L opacity, asx and on room air, but got CT chest wo. 
findings Tree-in-bud opacities in the right lower lobe likely reflect bronchiolitis and in conjunction with the lower lobe groundglass opacities on the left, findings may be related to aspiration/pneumonia.
no utox at time, but multiple prior cocaine + fentanyl pos uds, so presumed aspiration iso intoxication. dc from ed w augmentin.
