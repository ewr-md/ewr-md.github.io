Ingestion of cocaine may result in a wide array of disease processes due to its stimulant properties, contaminants, or to downstream effects, such as myo- cardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac arrest. Pulmonary complaints are common in patients seeking treatment for cocaine-associated medical problems and include acute eosinophilic pneumonia, pneumothorax, pneumomediastium, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ({DAH}), pulmonary hypertension and granulomatosis. We present a case of {DAH} due to cocaine abuse and rapid resolution with mechanical ventilation and supportive care.

	abstract = {Levamisole is an anti-helminthic drug with immunomodulatory properties that is added to cocaine to increase its potency and weight. Levamisole-adulterated cocaine ({LAC}) may cause an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ({ANCA})-associated systemic small vessel vasculitis ({AAV}). We aimed to characterize the phenotype of persons developing pulmonary-renal syndrome ({PRS}) in {LAC}-induced {AAV} and summarize its treatment and outcomes. Pubmed and Web of Science were searched (until September 2022). Reports that described co-existing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis in an adult (age ≥ 18) with confirmed or suspected {LAC} exposure were included. Reports, demographics, clinical and serologic features, treatment and outcome characteristics were extracted. Of the 280 records identified, eight met the inclusion criteria, including eight unique cases. Persons were aged 22-58 years, and 50\% were women. Cutaneous involvement occurred in only half of the cases. Other associated vasculitis findings and serologies were heterogeneous. All patients received immunosuppression with steroids, with cyclophosphamide and rituximab commonly added. We concluded that {PRS} could occur from {LAC}-induced {AAV}. Distinguishing {LAC}-induced {AAV} from primary {AAV} is challenging as clinical and serologic presentations overlap. Asking about cocaine use is requisite in persons presenting with {PRS} to guide diagnosis and appropriately counsel on cocaine cessation in conjunction with immunosuppression as treatment.},
